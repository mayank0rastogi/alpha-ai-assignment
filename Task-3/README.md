# Human Activity Recognition From A Video 

## External download :
'''
You need to dowwload a resnet-34_kinetics.onnx model from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/065l4vr8bptzohb/resnet-34_kinetics.onnx?dl=1) and once downloaded drop it inside the model directory of our project 
'''

In task 3 : That is human activity recognition by processing a video  i have used the pre-trained model name resnet-34_kinetics.onnx due to github restrictions of larger files i have mentioned link for the model.
